I assume I can just brainstorm here so this is some of what I'm thinking on my initial 
read through:

I see some potential issues here: "Skills going to be hard to balance initially, 
so DAO controlling the game can vote to add and disable skills.".

I would go for the DAO/community controlling the lore with their actual play thus 
altering the course of game development with their actions in game somehow. And the 
skills being alterable in some manner by everyone, like they can put together 
combinations of different primordial forces and base materials to produce effect 
spells that buff randomly generated skills that each dragon has when it's born.

Will the clusters be based on their position on a in game map or based on players 
physical locations? I like the in game map idea better myself because thats another 
thing the players could own and win pieces of (for an allotted/earned time).

I also have some ideas on the mating mechanic:
-They need to exchange NFT's to mate.
-Higher level dragons produce higher lever offspring, especially when both participants 
are high lvl.
-Chance of 50/50 ownership of the resulting dragon meaning rewards like XP are split 
between the players. Sort of a Co-op mode that you should be able to opt out of in 
setting somewhere.
```
#2
```
I was thinking clusters are completley separate. We can put them into a grid for sure 
- but don’t know what mechanics would be around it.
```
#3 (v3)
```
Maybe something like holding a base or location off from attackers or challenges of 
some kind, then those who fought own it for a time. You could also have dragon lairs/caves 
with differing benefits to the players in them based on the combined level/win loss record 
of the players inside it. Like if 2 clusters of the same level decide to fight one another 
they get a portion of the built up rewards of the opposing cluster.
```
#4
```
 - I was thinking it just gives the resulting one to one of the players, so you kind 
 of playing a rullet or should partner up somewhere in a chat and figure out how to 
 split proceeds
```
#5
```
- what do you mean exchange NFTs?
They each would have to have a pool of NFT available to give to be able to give one to 
the player they mate with as a gift. Like a representation of the exchange of various 
things that happens when people get together or a dowry when getting married in ancient 
times. I think it might be an interesting class of NFT's trying to impress people enough 
to mate with you.
```
#6
```
having gear that can adjust properties and give effects is def idea for next version
```
#7
```
def need a competition to reward first 10 players who achieve lvl10 and same for gen10 
dragons 🙂 “master breeder” and “battle master”
```
#8
```
Initial users who get to lvl10 first will become members of steering DAO for next version
```
#9 (V2)
```
add a couple an element users could earn dragon egg shards. 

Every 24 hours shards for 2 dragon eggs are minted ( all purely example numbers ) 

first egg - through staking their dragons in their caves when they are not being used. 
amount of shards dep on amount of dragons and dragons level in comparison to the the 
pool of all caved dragons. 

second through referrals of new users to the platform. each day the shards from egg 
2 get divided by total number of new invited users.

*would help teach new crypto users little bit of defi and help on board constant new 
users to the project.

-two possible options the first either collective ownership or 
funglibly tokenize the shards so a person can save up and get a new dragon
or possibly both... a users first dragon if they invite x number of new users
that reach x level they get their first egg free. and then possible different mechanics for the caved dragons
```

Golden Dragon Eggs
```
#12
```
For defense mechanics, it could be based on different defensive weapons or 
buildings tied to segments of land. So someone can customize their defenses 
based on these different pieces of land and what’s in that piece of land. 

Land could also be used as trade for mating like was mentioned earlier. 

Maybe everyone starts with a castle or piece of land artillery, or the cave 
is the initial piece of land, and you have to have a cave per mature dragon. 
```
#13
```
I like that. Some lands could lend themselves to be better at fending from different 
types of attacks. Very Sun Tzu https://suntzusaid.com/book/10
(Wow, after re reading, this is basically and outline haha. Would add even more value to the game in terms of knowledge too)
```
#14
```
While reading through repo I understood the game could have visual direction of card games (similar to hearthstone) ?
```
#15
```
After battle the winner could choose between getting XP or Treasure, similar to HOMM3 where after winning battle you choose XP or Chest.
Battling monsters/monster packs in different clusters for XP or resource farming might be a thing. Different cluster monsters can provide 
different resources. For example fire/lava cluster monsters could provide rubies which enhance fire dragons skills
```
#16
```
The idea of one of the players randomly receiving the offspring after dragon mating is perfect, but what about the other player who doesn't 
get the offspring? I'm sure there will be some power ups or booster for the other player's dragon too, couldn't find it on Github if it's 
already an idea. If not, then should be added.

and right now the only ways to gain xp/hp seem to be battle and resting... we need potions, spells and mating hp too... 
It will also help create more NPCs in the game which could sell/offer these potions and magic spells.. 
Like Wizards and Tribe leaders... These NPCs can be located at certain locations on the map... 
There can also be a market in game to trade potions and spells, endless possibilities
```
#17
```
Also in different clusters the player could take control of mines or village (which can be an NFT) and if player holds this NFT it gives a 
resource every day/week or month. Or player could build a village with gained resources from monster battles.
```
#18
```

[In reply to 17]
This was the original idea actually - looting villages with dragons.
Pretty much taking an iterative approach so we have playable game first.
Also sadly don’t have that much time (not flying that often) if anyone wants to contribute to the contract dev - let me know.
But first need help with a front end for the current functionality
```
#19
```
What if your “Kingdom” was a vault that you held your separate Dragon NFTs in and for adventures/battles, you have to send your dragons out to 
attack other kingdoms aka other players vaults. Rewards based on “Damage” done to other players “kingdom”
```
#20
```
response to 19 
One problem with this, is how to define who you can attack. If you can attack anyone and you know exact their state from chain - you will just attack weaker players
Using Zero Knowledge is too complicated IMO, though can be interesting over time.
```
#21
```
We can Automate it..
Like you will automatically receive a opponent..

then users will be in a specific rank or whatever we call it..
for a Custom opponent..
Users can only attack those who are in their league else choose a random opponent

that way users will find players from same levels only..and weaker players will remain in low ranks in will fight opponents capable of their league only
```
#22
```
PvP is the main element right now
```
#23
```
I think what would help the most is to establish some lore, some world building. That will determine the game mechanics you'll need. Are these dragons owned 
like pokemon, are they autonomous creatures that have their own lives. Do they train their skills and are intelligent or are they more animalistic and only 
improve through combat, etc.
```
#24
```
Yep, might be a good start indeed. Just wanted to remove the need to buy anything to start playing - instead people need to tweet about the game to get the 
first dragon. But can indeed have eggs first and birth them into dragons
```
#25
referral machanics 
main issue Bots.
verification that it’s another person not same person using bots
possible solutions
```
-Airdrop from whitelist 
-Discord
-To counter bots, you might have to reconsider this, where users have to buy to play
    -(Yeah will have to compromise one side i guess..
      either have some buying mechanism or either let some bots have fun lol
      but for buying part it'll definitely reduce number of initial players significantly)
-could add a restriction like for earning referral reward..
  The referred user must hold a specific amount of tokens & must be a old user of NEAR
  this way it'll help stop the spam of new wallets who are in for rewards only
-I think it should start permissionlessly and can add more effects later to people who already spent time in the game
-you will only get referral rewards when a reffered user reaches a specific level or collects specific number of dragons
    -so obviously a single guy won't be able to spam with more accounts since he'll have to level up all accounts
-retrospective referral rewards     
    -Yup can add daily login bonus or levelling up for being active and checking game daily 
-We can use unique NFTs, at first thought Mintgate comes to mind, cost per NFT will be negligible, to be eligible one must stake NEAR for a certain locking 
      period. That way users are actually paying nothing, just staking their NEAR and we also get them to be loyal to the product
            -Bots certainly won't stake tokens
            -People can mint their own NFTs then to invite their friends to play the game. Referral NFTs, exploring this idea should be fun!
-if its possible can integrate score system from stats.gallery
     can set a specific score limits for rewards😉
     if user have specific score then only he'll be eligible
     that site shows score depending on ur usage in near ecosystem            
-Tweet is also a good idea and then use an NEAR app to obtain the rewards. By doing this people are learning and getting involved in NEAR ecosystem/dapps            
-Maybe they just have to pay the gas fees which are minimum on NEAR
-agree but paras NFTs would be better because they would allow gated content in the game if the devs chose to. Only players with x item can do or enter x.
-those type of NFTs can be changeable, evolvable and combinable. You will be able to disaggregate components of NFTs to sell, or buy parts from other 
      users to assemble new ones.      
```
```
For social referrals:
There is a system we are working to impliment for a different project that I think would be a great fit for this.
user flow => 
   - user starts n landing page. 
  - <Play Button> = user login / browser temp wallet created / referral check & associate with referers userName if true
  - selects <UserName>
  - User recieves a unique random code word.
  - Player logs into DragonNEAR Discord server with their userName. 
  - Discord bot sends user private message asking for the code word.
  - Player gets a referral code. = (userName + first 4 digits of the hash of the userName)
  - Player invites new players
  - New Player hits landing page enters referal code and presses play
  
  - for every player they referred that earns/buys an egg they get a Dragon Egg Shard

```
re: lore. super important. If someone wants to take time to write a more deep lore for the DragonNEAR 
      people need to adopt to become dragonears or get extinct… there is no way back
      dragonear -> is when person merges with dragon’s mind and becomes one for a period of time.

Brainstorming Ideas
```
-Dynamic NFTs?
      Dragons can evolve overtime or change as they get more trained or the people have bought more in-game items
          -yeah or they can mutate or upgrade dragons by combining spells which will act as powerups      
-this discussion might be relevant https://gov.near.org/t/nft-alchemy-idea/322           

Dragons are already evolvable, they have lvl and skills that they acquire. And yes later can add equipment

-adding some single player way to play with dragons - go to training grounds or farm a 
      dangeon is important as well, to make sure PvP doesn’t get stalled because not enough active players
-Maybe buying and selling of in-game items as well.
    I.e. if we win a weapon and person already has it or don't want it then they can sell.
    They can also sell dragon eggs etc
    Sell dragons
-It seems to me that NEAR is in dire need of a battle royale project such as PUBG or FORTNITE. Battle Royale has 
    proven itself to be an amazing skin market, people are willing to pay fantastic money for skins. If these skins 
    are made in the form of NTF tokens, it could just blow up the market. I know a blorger who develops such a game 
    himself, it is only necessary to connect the NEAR economy to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OpAh2hrf9w&t=517s 
    How difficult is it to connect NTF to this game?
-yeah, I think it's actually necessary to avoid doing what Axie did to some extent
```
```
like in Axie you mostly just have to grind to earn money

most interesting question is – how to earn money which doesn't feel like grind, but is actually fun

so far I see these major ways:
- winning in game of skill where you also bet smth to participate
- producing user-generated content
- being early discoverer of various collectibles in game (i.e. you earn by following all game updates closely vs peeps who are more casual)
```
```
I like the Witcher model where you could have a little gamble, like Gwent as an in game activity
Maybe you could have some kind of dragon training move, and you can train the other dragons if you have that move and that earns you money?
```
```
I'll pitch my in-game NPC interaction idea again, with marketplaces to trade potions and magic spells which players can acquire by doing side 
quests for NPCs like Shamans, Wizards, Tribes etc. Even to gain XP/HP there should be another way apart from the dragon resting in the lair/den 
or winning fights. Maybe when one player gets the offspring after mating, both of the players get some amount of XP too and the offspring can be 
fed some potions to give it rare abilities.

    Good Thread about Play2Earn Game Models & which types got successful..
    Interesting thread
    -def creating more ways to play the game to participate in the economy is important
      -e.g. people who breed dragons to get eggs to then sell them to new players
```
```
I think it'll be cool if we can build marketplace inside of http://lands.near.page
I'm thinking to add some features where you can interact with smart contracts from withing world

Q? how to map clusters from dragonear to NEAR Lands?
A: it can be something like you purchase some region of land
   then there is API where you can tie some objects to smart contract calls
   smart contract call would receive context with stuff like tile coordinates
   then it is up to you to interpret these coordinates as you want, i.e. map to certain "cluster"
```
```
I think the market place is a good idea and doable. We could  make the items lazy minted nfts in the store. 
Have them minted on purchase and burnt when used. Could also have combinations that could trade different items 
to make a powered up dragon skill or better item. 

Also think including near lands could  be amazing. Could make it like an early Zelda game missions.. 
have to walk to the cave to wake the dragon or go to the arena to battle... To simplify the programming 
could just make a door or portal to walk through then it could 
load the battle scene for example. Could have stock characters giving quest info when people walk close to them...
```
```
an idea for V3.0 
V1&2 dragons live in theirs caves. 
V3 we can introduce castles they can attack and if they win the battle they can live in and defend the castle. 
Can start with different bot dragons living in them till the first users wins then it is up to them to defend it from the other DragoNEARs
```
```
what if ... 
Dragons have 10 traits that had 10 levels each. ( all numbers purely example) 
The baby dragon could get a max of 10 skill points at birth. 
each parent contributes up to 5 points each.
parents points calculated by their points out of the total 100. 
*example1* if one parent had a total of 20 skill points and the other dragon totaled 30. The baby would come out with 2.5 skill points. 
*example2 * both have 50 skill points the baby would start with 5. 
*example3* both have 100 points baby would be born at level 10. 
could randomize it a bit with a range of points each level their dragon is at will get them.
```
The story starts with a unknown person finding the first dragon egg… and not knowingly starting a chain reaction in the world of dragon uprising…
